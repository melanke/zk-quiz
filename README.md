# ZK Quiz

Allows creating questions with a hidden response that can be safely answered without compromising it's secret.

- User A inputs the question and response, which will be hashed using poseidon and stored on the contract;
- User B can answer and test if it matches locally. Then they can create a proof they know the answer attached to their address and submit to the contract, which will validate and save the "check-in" in the contract.
- No one will be to know discover the answer because it's hidden within the proof.
- No one will be able to replicate the request because the proof is bond to User B's address.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-zk-quiz
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit the app on: `http://localhost:3000`. 

## Known issues to be fixed:

### General Styling
- layout: it's using default SE template, we should use something more similar to shadcn default style
- header: The home page should be /quiz/
- Remove the ZK Test page
- Replace alerts for toasts on the whole app
- The textarea rounded borders are strange (present in /quiz/create and other pages)

### /quiz
- The title doesn't have contrast
- Remove the ID from the card

### /quiz/create
- We don't need that "Variable length" text
- Remove "Calculate Answer Hash" button and the two cards below it, the hash should be calculated and checked for duplicates as you type with a debounce. And we should only receive a message if it finds duplicates

### /quiz/question
- Don't show the hash
- Remove the button "Verify Answer", check if true as you type with a debounce
- Show questions that depends on it
- When answering a question that depends on other, only allow answering if you got that first right, and show an input for the previous answer that will be pr√©-filled with the answer it got from the localstorage

### /quiz/profile
- On the questions card it shouldn't show the hash and on "Questions Answered" it's not showing the Question text

### ???
- Both on question card and question details page the "Answered" badge should be different if the question is not submitted yet, maybe it should show "Pending"
- Both on the "Who answered this question" card and the user profile page, we should fix the avatar using the one from ENS. And the address should be shown without a duplicated avatar.

### Submitting Checkins
- Instead of a button on the header, let's have a persistent panel on the botton corner that shows all pending questions and a checkbox on each (marked as default) to signal if you want to submit that question; Fix the sending mechanism to send all questions in the same transaction or change the contract to accept multiple.

### Hashtags and Mentions
- Use Ponder to index hashtags and mentions
-
